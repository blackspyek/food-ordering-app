# Food Ordering App

Welcome to the **Food Ordering App**! This project is designed to streamline the process of placing and managing food orders. The application consists of three main components:

- **Backend**: A robust Spring application handling business logic and database interactions.
- **Employee Frontend**: A JavaFX application for employees to manage orders efficiently.
- **Customer App**: An Android application that allows customers to place orders seamlessly.

## Features

- **Order Management**: Customers can create, view, and manage their orders directly from the Android app.
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time updates on order status (preparing, ready for pickup) via WebSockets.
- **Employee Dashboard**: JavaFX application for employees to view and update order statuses, ensuring smooth operations.
- **Order Tracking**: Customers receive notifications about their order status and estimated ready times.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: 
  - Spring Boot
  - Spring WebSocket
  - Supabase (for database and generated Private Token)
  
- **Frontend**: 
  - JavaFX (for the employee interface)
  - Android (for the customer application) API 35

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 23 or higher
- Maven
- Gradle
- Android Studio (for the customer app)
- Supabase Project

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/food-ordering-app.git
   cd food-ordering-app
2. **Set up the Backend**:
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Configure your database connection in `.env` with .example.env. Make sure to set the correct database URL, username, and password.
   - Add firebase configuration
   - Build and run the Spring Boot application:
     ```bash
     ./gradlew bootRun
     ```

3. **Set up the Employee Frontend**:
   - Navigate to the `employee-frontend` directory:
     ```bash
     cd gui/test
     ```
   - Ensure you have the necessary JavaFX libraries added to your project.
   - Build and run the JavaFX application. You can do this directly from your IDE or use a build tool if configured.

4. **Set up the Customer App**:
   - Open the `customer-app` directory in Android Studio.
   - Sync the project with Gradle files to ensure all dependencies are correctly set up.
   - Add Firebase config for notification
   - Run the application on an Android device or emulator to start placing orders.

## Usage

- **For Customers**:
  - Open the Android app, and start placing orders.
